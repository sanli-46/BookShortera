# BookShortera

- We designed a class called Book.

- This class inherits from Comparable interface and override "compareTo" method.

- In this method, he sorted the book by name from A to Z.

- We created 5 objects of this class and stored the objects in a Set type structure.

- Then we used a data structure of Set type for the second time and sorted the books according to the number of pages.

- The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.
